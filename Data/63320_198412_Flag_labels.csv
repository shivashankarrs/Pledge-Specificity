178,179,63320_198412_179,"-Second, any reform must continue the process already begun by this Government, and provide further major cuts in personal income tax.",,4
179,180,63320_198412_180,-Third taxation changes must contribute to smashing tax avoidance and evasion which remain as features of the tax system which the Government inherited.,,3
180,181,63320_198412_181,"-Fourth, any reform must lead to a simpler system which therefore all Australians can understand more easily, and which therefore makes tax avoidance and evasion more difficult.",,4
181,182,63320_198412_182,"-Fifth, any reform package must result in a tax system which is fairer, so that Australians are only required to pay tax according to their capacity to pay, and the overall system must be progressive.",,3
182,183,63320_198412_183,"- Sixth, any tax reform must not disadvantage recipients of welfare benefits, and should reduce or remove “poverty traps”.",,1
183,184,63320_198412_184,"-Seventh, if any reform package which includes changes in indirect taxes is contemplated, it must be acceptable to the various groups in the Australian community whose response will determine whether we can maintain moderation in wage movements.",,1
184,185,63320_198412_185,"-Eighth, any reform must provide the best possible climate for investment, growth and employment in Australia.",,1
185,186,63320_198412_186,"-Ninth, any reform package must have widespread community support, including support at a widely representative national tax Summit of economic organisations and community groups.",,1

189,190,63320_198412_190,"I made it clear then, and I made it clear at the Summit itself, that there would be no abdication and that the elected Government would exercise in full measure its role and responsibility for the economic management and the economic decision-making of this country.",,1
