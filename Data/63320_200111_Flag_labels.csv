136,137,63320_20011_137,That's why I announce today that Labor will spend an extra $1 billion on our Plan for Quality Universities.,0,7
137,138,63320_20011_138,The centrepiece is a new fund of nearly $500 million.,0,1
138,139,63320_20011_139,"Universities, drawing on this fund, will be able to improve the quality of teaching and research by employing more lecturers and tutors, and reducing class sizes.",0,7
139,140,63320_20011_140,"It will also be used to increase salaries for our best academic teachers and researchers to help end the brain drain, and to equip university libraries with new resources.",0,7

152,153,63320_20011_153,"Currently, too many teaching professionals are tied up with behaviour problems, and getting children up to speed in basic reading, writing and maths.",1,1
153,154,63320_20011_154,These new people will help our teachers to get on with teaching the subjects for which they were trained.,0,1

161,162,63320_20011_162,"This will dramatically increase the amount of private funding going into our universities for the basic research needed to boost existing industries, and to kick start new industries.",0,1
162,163,63320_20011_163,"Enormous opportunities exist for Australia to become a world leader in key industries such as biotechnology, information technology and environmental sustainability.",1,1
