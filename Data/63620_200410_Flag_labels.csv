96,97,63620_200410_97,My claim that interest rates would be higher under Labor is also supported by the impact of their industrial relations policy.,1.0,1
97,98,63620_200410_98,"They will run an industrial relations policy where wages will rise not based on productivity, because they will take productivity out of the equation, and if wages go up not based on productivity, they become inflationary.",1.0,1
98,99,63620_200410_99,"And inevitably if you have inflationary wage rises, the Reserve Bank will retaliate by lifting interest rates.",1.0,1

100,101,63620_200410_101,That is why I assert unconditionally that interest rates will always be higher under a Labor Government than a Coalition Government.,1.0,1
101,102,63620_200410_102,"Our budget, thanks to the magnificent work of Peter Costello and his colleagues, is strong and in surplus.",1.0,1

104,105,63620_200410_105,The Coalition and the Labor Party are divided in this election campaign on many issues.,1.0,1
105,106,63620_200410_106,But there's one issue on which we are not divided.,1.0,1
106,107,63620_200410_107,Both sides of politics in Australia are committed to the maintenance of Medicare.,,4
107,108,63620_200410_108,There is no argument between the Labor Party and the Coalition on Medicare.,,1
108,109,63620_200410_109,"In fact, the Coalition has strengthened Medicare by the introduction of a Medicare safety net.",1.0,1
109,110,63620_200410_110,But Labor would abolish the Medicare safety net.,1.0,1
110,111,63620_200410_111,"Labor would take away a measure that has already provided invaluable support to 600,000 Australians and their families.",1.0,1

114,115,63620_200410_115,We must further entrench the entrepreneurial culture within the Australian nation.,,3
115,116,63620_200410_116,We must address the ageing of our population and we must balance our need for economic growth with protection of our precious environment.,,3
116,117,63620_200410_117,So much of our economic growth to date has been based on productivity improvements.,1.0,1
117,118,63620_200410_118,There are two threats to this.,1.0,1
118,119,63620_200410_119,"The first of those threats, which I have outlined, is that of Labor's industrial relations policy.",1.0,1
119,120,63620_200410_120,Labor would return control of industrial relations to the union movement.,1.0,1
120,121,63620_200410_121,"Only 17.5 per cent of the private sector workforce in this country belongs to a union, yet Labor wants to give 100 per cent control of that system to the trade union movement.",1.0,1
121,122,63620_200410_122,Labor will abolish Australian Workplace Agreements.,1.0,1
122,123,63620_200410_123,Labor will adopt a double standard in relation to secondary boycotts under the Trade Practices Act.,1.0,1
123,124,63620_200410_124,"Labor will give unions a special deal, Labor will bring back preference clauses.",1.0,1
124,125,63620_200410_125,The cover was blown on that by the CFMEU on Friday.,1.0,1
125,126,63620_200410_126,Labor will require anybody who makes a contract with the Federal Government to disclose the identity of the subcontractors.,1.0,1
126,127,63620_200410_127,Labor will go back to the 50s and 60s when it comes to industrial relations and that will inevitably produce inflationary wage rises with all the consequences for interest rates that that entails.,1.0,1
127,128,63620_200410_128,The other great challenge is of course our shortage of skills and in a way this has been a consequence of our very economic success and I will therefore have something to say about that issue in a moment.,1.0,1
128,129,63620_200410_129,But I have some policy initiatives to outline to you today including one in relation to skills.,1.0,1
129,130,63620_200410_130,Let me say that all of the initiatives that I outline today reflect very directly the values and attitudes which have shaped me all the years that I've spent in public life.,1.0,1
130,131,63620_200410_131,First and foremost a belief in the central role of the family in the Australian community.,,3
131,132,63620_200410_132,A belief that the family is the greatest source of emotional support and inspiration that an individual can ever have.,,6
132,133,63620_200410_133,As the son of a small business owner an unshakeable belief in the role of dynamic small business as an engine of economic progress and personal self-fulfillment.,,3
133,134,63620_200410_134,A passionate belief in flexible workplaces free of rigidity in the industrial system and unwanted union interference.,,3
134,135,63620_200410_135,And a firm commitment to strong budgets as the way to keep interest rates down and underpin a capacity to spend more in areas of human services.,,6
135,136,63620_200410_136,There's a golden thread that runs through so many Coalition policies and that is that great principle of choice.,,3
136,137,63620_200410_137,Greater choice for families to choose how they will balance their work and their family responsibilities.,,3
137,138,63620_200410_138,Greater choice for entrepreneurial Australians to start and expand their small business.,,3

143,144,63620_200410_144,This is in part a product of our great economic success.,1.0,1
144,145,63620_200410_145,It's also the legacy of some bad decisions we made a generation or more ago.,1.0,1
145,146,63620_200410_146,This country made a big mistake 30 or 40 years ago when it turned its back on the old system of having technical skills.,1.0,1
146,147,63620_200410_147,Those skills taught earlier generations to be tradesman and women.,1.0,1
147,148,63620_200410_148,We now must reinvest in the future of the 70% of young Australians who do not go directly to university when they leave school.,,5

151,152,63620_200410_152,"But today, I announce the centerpiece of our drive to tackle skills shortages and to revolutionise vocational education and training throughout Australia.",,6
152,153,63620_200410_153,A re-elected Coalition Government will establish 24 Australian Technical Colleges to accelerate national skills development in traditional trades.,,5
153,154,63620_200410_154,"These select high achievement colleges will provide tuition in a given year for up to 7,200 students in years 11 and 12 and will offer both academic and vocational education to students.",,5
154,155,63620_200410_155,These colleges will be located in regions suffering serious skills shortages and high rates of youth unemployment and which are supported by a significant industry base.,,5

180,181,63620_200410_181,"This will permit more businesses, including in particular, many in the farming sector to take advantage of the concessions associated with the Simplified Taxation System and that will give tax relief of over $330 million to small businesses over a period of three years.",,7
181,182,63620_200410_182,"Secondly, and importantly, we're going to provide extra incentive and encouragement to small business growth through the introduction, from the 1st of July next year, of a new 25% Entrepreneurs Tax Discount.",,5

246,247,63620_200410_247,And this new programme - Round the Clock Medicare - invests in after hours GP services in two ways.,,1
247,248,63620_200410_248,Firstly by giving GPs greater incentives to practice after hours by increasing Medicare rebates on after hours GP services by $10 from the 1st of January 2005.,,7
248,249,63620_200410_249,This loading will be over and above the other benefits of strengthening Medicare and 100 per cent Medicare.,,5
