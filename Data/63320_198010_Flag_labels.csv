2,4,63320_198010_4,"They are policies to bring Australians together, not drive them apart, policies that unite our country, policies that allow all Australians to share our national good fortune and to play their part in the development of our future.",,3
3,5,63320_198010_5,"And that, I suggest, is really the great issue before us in the elections on October 18th.",1.0,1
4,6,63320_198010_6,"The challenges that face Australia now, and in the years ahead, are challenges that face us all as a nation.",1.0,1
5,7,63320_198010_7,"To meet these challenges is not solely the responsibility of government, or big business, or the trade unions, or any other single group or institution in our community.",1.0,1
6,8,63320_198010_8,We all have a responsibility to each other and to our country.,,3
7,9,63320_198010_9,We all face these challenges together.,,2
8,10,63320_198010_10,"Australia's worst unemployment in half a century is not isolated to the great industrial complexes of NSW, or Victoria, or South Australia.",1.0,1
9,11,63320_198010_11,It extends into all States.,1.0,1
10,12,63320_198010_12,"The highest prices in our history are not confined to the supermarkets of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, or the other great cities of our Commonwealth.",1.0,1
11,13,63320_198010_13,They must be paid by families in even the smallest country town.,1.0,1
12,14,63320_198010_14,"Record taxes and falling living standards are not a burden carried only by some people in some States, but by all people wherever they live, except for a small minority of high income earners.",1.0,1

15,17,63320_198010_17,All these destructive elements have gained momentum during the last five years.,1.0,1
16,18,63320_198010_18,All come together now to pose great challenges to which all of us as a nation must respond together.,,3
17,19,63320_198010_19,I don't pretend there are easy solutions.,1.0,1
18,20,63320_198010_20,There are not.,1.0,1
19,21,63320_198010_21,I don't suggest that a rash of election promises is all that's needed to meet these challenges.,1.0,1
20,22,63320_198010_22,They won't and the record of the Fraser Government proves that they won't.,1.0,1
21,23,63320_198010_23,"And I do not claim that a Hayden Labor Government can produce some magic formula overnight to correct all the mistakes, all the hardship, and all the disunity created since 1975.",1.0,1
22,24,63320_198010_24,We can't.,1.0,1
23,25,63320_198010_25,"What we do offer what we can promise is a more equal, a fairer, and a better Australian society than all of us have known in the last five years.",,2
24,26,63320_198010_26,Our country has tremendous potential.,1.0,1
25,27,63320_198010_27,Its development of our industries and our great mineral resources suggests there is nothing we can't achieve in the years ahead.,1.0,1
26,28,63320_198010_28,What we have to ensure is the economic security of Australian families just as much as the physical security of our nation under responsible national leadership administering fair and sensible national policies.,,3
27,29,63320_198010_29,"The important thing, the urgent thing, is to deal not only with our specific problems, but to restore a sense of unity, purpose and direction for the entire country.",,2
28,30,63320_198010_30,That is what we are doing tonight.,,2
29,31,63320_198010_31,"That is what our policies will do, and that is what a national Labor Government will do, after the 18th of October.",,6
30,32,63320_198010_32,I make no apology whatever for the fact that our basic economic strategy is a policy of six broad programs to reverse the decline in family living standards.,,5
31,33,63320_198010_33,"These programs concern taxes, housing, jobs, petrol and energy prices, family health care, and family allowances.",,3
32,34,63320_198010_34,All six areas have an appalling record over the last five years.,1.0,1
33,35,63320_198010_35,All have contributed to the stark reality that the average Australian family is today $16 a week worse off than in 1975.,1.0,1
34,36,63320_198010_36,Five years ago our standard of living was the 8th highest among western industrial countries.,1.0,1
35,37,63320_198010_37,Today it has slipped sharply down to 16th.,1.0,1
36,38,63320_198010_38,All Australians are entitled to ask why?,1.0,1
37,39,63320_198010_39,"Why has this happened in this wealthy and resourcerich country of ours, one of the wealthiest in the world.",1.0,1
38,40,63320_198010_40,Why this decline in our living standards?,1.0,1
39,41,63320_198010_41,In our quality of life?,1.0,1
40,42,63320_198010_42,In the opportunities and advantages for our people?,1.0,1
41,43,63320_198010_43,We intend to reverse the process.,,1
42,44,63320_198010_44,"By doing so, by increasing the real value of the average family income, we restore the security of the family unit in our society.",,5
43,45,63320_198010_45,"By improving our basic living standard, we encourage people to spend more to buy more goods and services.",,6
44,46,63320_198010_46,"This in turn creates more demand, more production, more jobs, and so the cycle continues as the economy regains confidence and starts moving again.",,2
45,47,63320_198010_47,What we propose is not only a policy to increase the value of the family pay packet.,,3
46,48,63320_198010_48,It is a broad economic strategy to lift the Australian economy out of the rut of the last five years and to bring down inflation.,,3
47,49,63320_198010_49,The most immediate and the most dramatic impact we can make in this process is some moderation in the taxes all families pay.,,3
48,50,63320_198010_50,Six weeks ago I outlined in Parliament three options we were considering in this area: (I) an acrosstheboard cut in income tax costing $300 million this financial year.,,7
49,51,63320_198010_51,(2) a general reduction in sales tax costing an equivalent amount.,,5
50,52,63320_198010_52,(3) a cut of three cents a litre in all petroleum products.,,5
51,53,63320_198010_53,"We'd all like to adopt all three proposals, but in the present economic climate this is neither possible nor responsible.",,6
52,54,63320_198010_54,"And unlike Mr Fraser in the last two elections, we will not make promises we cannot keep or which cannot be paid for.",,6
53,55,63320_198010_55,"Instead, we have decided to propose a general cut in income tax to nut an extra $3 a week into all pay packets from February 1 next year.",,7
54,56,63320_198010_56,This will be achieved by raising the tax free income level from the present $4041 a year to $4529.,,7
55,57,63320_198010_57,"It will free literally hundreds of thousands of low income earners from paying any income tax at all, including 200,000 pensioners, and give a uniform $3 a week tax cut to all other taxpayers.",,7
56,58,63320_198010_58,"Despite what our opponents say, this is a tax cut the country can afford.",1.0,1
57,59,63320_198010_59,"After all, the Fraser Government's latest Budget two months ago proposes to collect 32 thousand million dollars in all taxes this year.",1.0,1
58,60,63320_198010_60,That's almost double the tax burden of five years ago.,1.0,1
59,61,63320_198010_61,"Our proposal, costing $300 million, means a reduction of about one cent in every dollar paid in all taxes in the 12 months to the end of next June.",,7
60,62,63320_198010_62,So it cannot be described as anything else except a very modest tax cut.,,5
61,63,63320_198010_63,"We'd like to do more, but we can't and this is a start.",,2
62,64,63320_198010_64,"In the longer term, we'd propose a complete overhaul of the entire tax structure so as to introduce a much fairer system than the one now operating.",,3
63,65,63320_198010_65,"For the moment, however, we cannot responsibly go any further than the proposal I've just outlined.",,3
64,66,63320_198010_66,Our other programs in this package of family policies will compound the benefit of an immediate reduction in taxation.,,3
65,67,63320_198010_67,All of these programs have been carefully worked out and carefully costed.,,1
66,68,63320_198010_68,All of them have been announced progressively over the last 11 months.,,1
67,69,63320_198010_69,What we've sought to do is explain our policies in open public debate well before the elections.,1.0,1
68,70,63320_198010_70,In this way we've avoided our opponents' expedient alternative of a grab-bag of promises and scare tactics in the last weeks before polling day.,1.0,1
69,71,63320_198010_71,Housing is one such area of national need and national priority.,,1
70,72,63320_198010_72,The great Australian dream of owning your own home is now out of reach of most families.,1.0,1
71,73,63320_198010_73,Our Family Home Ownership Plan announced last February will cut deposits on homes by as much as 50 per cent for families buying their first home.,,5
72,74,63320_198010_74,"It involves a Government grant of $3000 to be used to borrow as much as another $9750 from building societies, or an extra $11,300 from the banks, without having to make higher repayments.",,7
73,75,63320_198010_75,Again it's a modest proposal we can afford.,1.0,1
74,76,63320_198010_76,And again it's an initiative that's an absolute priority because of the Fraser Government's failure to keep its promises on interest rates.,1.0,1
75,77,63320_198010_77,Three years ago we were told that interest rates would come down two per cent in 12 months.,1.0,1
76,78,63320_198010_78,That promise was never kept.,1.0,1
77,79,63320_198010_79,Interest rates are now the highest in our history.,1.0,1
78,80,63320_198010_80,And they're going up again by as much as another two per cent.,1.0,1
79,81,63320_198010_81,The Government is desperately trying to hold them down until after the elections.,1.0,1
80,82,63320_198010_82,What the increase will mean is higher home loan repayments and higher bank overdraft rates.,1.0,1
81,83,63320_198010_83,Our family home plan will moderate the impact of these higher charges until we can get economic management under control.,,5
82,84,63320_198010_84,And I have no doubt we will do better in controlling interest rates over the next three years than Mr Fraser has been able to manage in the last five years.,,5
83,85,63320_198010_85,Similarly we must take resolute and positive action to reduce unemployment.,,5
84,86,63320_198010_86,The Fraser Government fights inflation by allowing unemployment to get worse.,1.0,1
85,87,63320_198010_87,In five years inflation has come down less than three per cent.,1.0,1
86,88,63320_198010_88,"In the same period unemployment has gone up 170,000.",1.0,1
87,89,63320_198010_89,That's an enormous cost for the many thousands of families involved.,1.0,1
88,90,63320_198010_90,Every Australian must have the right to a job.,,2
89,91,63320_198010_91,"That is a principle we cannot, and will not, abandon.",,2
90,92,63320_198010_92,"It won't be easy, and it won't be quick.",1.0,1
91,93,63320_198010_93,But it must be attempted.,,1
92,94,63320_198010_94,"As a first step, we announced last March we would create 100,000 new jobs in our first full year of office for those Australians who need them most.",,7
93,95,63320_198010_95,They will be real jobs providing earned wages instead of welfare handouts.,,3
94,96,63320_198010_96,"50,000 of these jobs will be for young people between 16 and 24 under our Community Service Corps Program.",,5
95,97,63320_198010_97,"Another 20,000 jobs will be created for unemployed adults with dependents, while a further, 30,000 new jobs and training positions will be subsidised up to 50 per cent in firms, factories, and small business.",,7
96,98,63320_198010_98,Certainly these programs will cost money ... $180 million in our first year.,,7
97,99,63320_198010_99,But it will be money well spent.,,1
98,100,63320_198010_100,And let me say this: In five years Mr Fraser spent $1600 million of taxpayers money on a tax incentive scheme for factories and industry.,1.0,1
99,101,63320_198010_101,Employers used the scheme to replace jobs with machines.,1.0,1
100,102,63320_198010_102,A Labor Government will not feel embarrassed about spending $180 million in getting some of those jobs back.,,7
101,103,63320_198010_103,Tied in with our job programs is a broad agreement we have negotiated with the trade union movement on the development of economic policy.,,3
102,104,63320_198010_104,What this agreement does is establish the framework for consultation and negotiation between a Labor Government and the trade unions on incomes and prices.,,3
103,105,63320_198010_105,It is the first time in this country such an agreement has been reached.,,2
104,106,63320_198010_106,"It does not guarantee success, and I won't mislead you that it does.",,7
105,107,63320_198010_107,"But it was drawn up only after months of patient discussion and negotiation, and it establishes the goodwill of both sides in taking industrial relations out of the jungle of provocation and confrontation.",,3
106,108,63320_198010_108,Nobody likes strikes.,1.0,1
107,109,63320_198010_109,Nobody wants strikes.,1.0,1
108,110,63320_198010_110,But threatening the unions with punitive legislation is no way to bring industrial harmony and industrial peace to the Australian workplace.,1.0,1
109,111,63320_198010_111,Five years of Mr Fraser's industrial policies have not achieved anything except to embitter trade unionists and increase the number of strikes.,1.0,1
110,112,63320_198010_112,There is no doubt we will do a great deal better with Bob Hawke as Minister for Industrial Relations to make a fair and proper incomes policy work.,,3
111,113,63320_198010_113,Undoubtedly the greatest stimulus to inflation in the last five years has been the rapid increase in petrol prices and medical insurance.,1.0,1
112,114,63320_198010_114,The price of petrol has more than doubled in five years.,1.0,1
113,115,63320_198010_115,And 50 cents in every dollar spent on petrol goes straight to the Government in petrol tax.,1.0,1
114,116,63320_198010_116,We can't blame overseas oil prices.,1.0,1
115,117,63320_198010_117,Ninety per cent of our petrol comes from our own oil in Bass Strait.,1.0,1
116,118,63320_198010_118,"It doesn't cost any more to produce, it simply costs more for the motorist to buy.",1.0,1
117,119,63320_198010_119,"It is a taxing policy, not an energy policy.",1.0,1
118,120,63320_198010_120,And it feeds into inflation throughout our economy.,1.0,1
119,121,63320_198010_121,A Labor Government will freeze the price of all locally produced crude oil for 12 months from next January 1.,,6
120,122,63320_198010_122,"If this freeze had applied last year, petrol already would be cheaper by 23 cents a gallon, or more than 5 cents a litre.",,7
121,123,63320_198010_123,Medical insurance is another area where Government decisions have forced up inflation.,1.0,1
122,124,63320_198010_124,Five years ago Mr Fraser promised to maintain Medibank.,1.0,1
123,125,63320_198010_125,"Instead, in a series of bewildering changes, he demolished the most important social welfare reform in the last 30 years.",1.0,1
124,126,63320_198010_126,A Labor Government is committed to restoring universal health insurance.,,6
125,127,63320_198010_127,"It cannot be done immediately, but as a first step we announced 11 months ago we will extend free medical care in the next Budget to all expectant mothers and all dependent children.",,5
126,128,63320_198010_128,"Finally, in these six broad areas of family programs, is a policy we announced last May to give higher family allowances to those families who need them most.",,5
127,129,63320_198010_129,Family allowances have not increased for more than four years.,1.0,1
128,130,63320_198010_130,They are now worth almost half their value when the scheme was introduced in 1976.,1.0,1
129,131,63320_198010_131,"Since then inflation has gone up well over 40 per cent, while taxes have increased more than 90 per cent.",1.0,1
130,132,63320_198010_132,"Given the cost of our other programs, we cannot responsibly propose a general increase in family allowances.",0.0,2
131,133,63320_198010_133,"What we do propose is a sliding scale of income supplement payments ranging between $1 and $4 a week for each child for families with incomes up to a ceiling of $14,000 a year, or $270 a week.",0.0,7
132,134,63320_198010_134,Lower income families living on pay packets of less than $155 a week will get the full benefit of an additional $4 a week for each child.,0.0,3
133,135,63320_198010_135,"In summary, these six programs will give a direct financial benefit of between $10 and $20 a week to the average family in our community.",0.0,7
134,136,63320_198010_136,All programs will be brought into operation in our first year of office.,0.0,3
135,137,63320_198010_137,Legislation enacting the income tax cut will be brought down in the New Year.,0.0,3
136,138,63320_198010_138,These programs are needed and they are necessary.,1.0,1
137,139,63320_198010_139,We do not flinch from the additional cost of a maximum $550 million they will impose on this year's Budget.,0.0,7
138,140,63320_198010_140,It is a sum well within the limits of responsible economic management.,1.0,1
139,141,63320_198010_141,I repeat: it is money well spent in returning some measure of justice to the living standards of all our people.,0.0,3
140,142,63320_198010_142,It endorses a fair go for Australian families.,0.0,2
141,143,63320_198010_143,"There is another policy area of vital relevance to family welfare and family development, and that is education.",1.0,1
142,144,63320_198010_144,"Our education policy, announced three months ago, reverses the cutback in education funding of the last three years.",0.0,6
143,145,63320_198010_145,It commits a national Labor Government to increase spending by $100 million a year for each of the next three years in areas of education of the greatest need.,0.0,7
144,146,63320_198010_146,I repeat: in areas of education of greatest need.,0.0,1
145,147,63320_198010_147,That principle applies equally for government schools and non-government schools.,0.0,3
146,148,63320_198010_148,We do not believe that money spent on the future of our country's children is money wasted.,0.0,2
147,149,63320_198010_149,I now want to say something about general welfare programs.,1.0,1
148,150,63320_198010_150,What we can do immediately in the welfare area is enormously restricted by the extent of our other programs and what we can responsibly spend.,1.0,1
149,151,63320_198010_151,The greatest service a Labor Government can do for all Australians at this time is to restore a buoyant national economy.,0.0,3
150,152,63320_198010_152,We have to get the economy moving and our people back into work.,0.0,5
151,153,63320_198010_153,The whole thrust of our family programs is designed to do just this.,0.0,6
152,154,63320_198010_154,A healthy economy with strong economic growth will allow us in future years to give greater attention to broad welfare programs.,0.0,3
153,155,63320_198010_155,But even in these restricted circumstances there are two welfare areas we consider of absolute need that cannot be overlooked.,0.0,5
154,156,63320_198010_156,We will extend free pharmaceutical benefits to the unemployed at a cost of $3.8 million.,0.0,7
155,157,63320_198010_157,"And we will, in the next Budget, index the means test on fringe benefits available to pensioners at a cost of some $3 million.",0.0,7
156,158,63320_198010_158,"I would emphasise, in this context, the 200,000 pensioners who will be freed from all income tax by the provisions of our proposed change to the tax free zone.",0.0,5
157,159,63320_198010_159,This will be of greatest benefit to many in our community in greatest need.,0.0,3
158,160,63320_198010_160,We remain committed to lifting pensions to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings as and when economic circumstances permit.,0.0,5
159,161,63320_198010_161,We achieved the objective in 1975.,1.0,1
